# v2_chat
A terminal Chat program written in C. Only meant for P2P with 2 users. 

I am currently interested in this project because of my interests in specializing
Network Programming. Writing a chat program will allow me to practice threading in C
at the same time. If you see any unsafe procedures or techniques in my coding please
let me know, as I would like to stay far away from buffer overflows, & implement
proper ANSI C standards.


This program is crude but functional, I am in the process of cleaning it up and
implementing a "better look". The program is on terminal only with no GUI. Although,
in the future I might delve into a GUI version of v2, and apply a "chat room" functionality
instead of just 2 users.
